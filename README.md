This is our example of a node.js/socket.io chatroom. In this, users can login (only one user can have the same name at one time). Upon logging in, they
can create a chatroom with or without a password, or they may see all available chatrooms. Upon joining a chatroom, the user who joined is echoed to everyone
in the chatroom, and they are then able to send messages to other users in the room.


If a user would like to send a private message/ban/kick to another user, they can do so by
    1. either clicking the name of the user at the top of the page, 
 or 2. clicking the URL in the chat which is appended in the chat upon a user joining.
 
 Users are able to leave rooms, and join other rooms.
 
 For the creative portion, we thought we'd make our chat room more "modern", byadd a "X is typing" feature which shows other users in the room 
 who is about to send a message. On top of this, we added some of the most common emojis, and the unicode inputs you must use in order to put an emoji in your message. 
 This took us ~2hours to do.
 
 Thank you to the TAs for their help throughout this project, and for taking the time to grade this.
